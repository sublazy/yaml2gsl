# Mappings like this should not be allowed. We have a sequence of multiple
# creatures. So we have to create <creature> tags. But then we have a dangling
# value "bat", which should become a value of some attribute, but there's no
# attribute to assign it to.
#
# Another problem: this sequence element is a mapping with three key-value
# pairs. But in mappings the order of elements doesn't matter, so it's not
# clear which of the keys should become the xml tag name.
#
#  - creature: bat
#    hp: 40
#    type: flying
#
# equivalent form:
#  - {creature: snake, hp: 32, type: ground}

  - creature: {name: emu, hp: 50}
